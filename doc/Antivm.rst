Pafish
======

The objective of this project is to collect usual tricks seen 
in malware samples. 

This allows us to study it, and test if our analysis environments 
are properly implemented.

To run pafish, get the latest release from: https://github.com/a0rtega/pafish 
And launch it in your VM.

Alternatively, you can send it as an analysis, and wath for created
files like "hi_virtualbox" and so on.

Improving vm detection
======================

@nsmfoo has done a great job with this script: 
https://github.com/nsmfoo/antivmdetection/blob/master/antivmdetect.py

that creates a batch file and a shell script to make vm detection harder.

VBoxHardenedLoader
======================
VirtualBox VM detection mitigation loader: https://github.com/hfiref0x/VBoxHardenedLoader

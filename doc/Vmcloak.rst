    VMCloak is a utility for automatically creating Virtual Machines with 
    Windows as guest Operating System. It has been tailored to generate 
    Virtual Machines directly usable from within Cuckoo Sandbox,
    but it can also be used for other purposes as Cuckooâ€˜s components
    can be omitted through the configuration.
